I seem to be good at delaying working on Mercenary Contract Generator (MCG) but at least I'm learning new stuff. :) Currently reading up on using Maven, as well as Ant, and continuous integration which all should be useful knowledge for work, as well as getting the MCG project set up well. But because of the fun of learning, I'm not working on any actual code... although the goal is still there. I've set some timelines for myself which I'm still ahead of where I wanted to be which is good.
