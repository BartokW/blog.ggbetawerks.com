Well, as you can see from the length of time between posts, I've obviously failed on the one resolution. Just after posting my list of resolutions, I put in about 4 or 5 hours work of work on Mercenary Contract Generator (MCG) which got the code into a stable point. I was switching to a new plugin framework, as well as switching to using Maven as a build tool. I now have all my work compiling using maven, and some code switched over to the new plugin framework. The plugin switch causes me to have to rethink how I'm planning on building it, and so I left it to ponder... then something called Star Trek Online came out, and I've been spending my free time playing that. Guess I need to get my act together and get the rest of the code ported over to the new framework. Then I can at least start moving ahead again.
