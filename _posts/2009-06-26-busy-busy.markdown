Figure I need to get a post in so that I have at least one for June. :) Work has been busy, as well as summer always seems to have lots going on at home. As for work, we will be moving to a new location by the end of summer which should be good, although adding more work. I have relatives and friends coming to visit all through the summer so I should keep busy. Just need to find some time to work on my programming projects. And now that I have a June post, I'll stop typing.
