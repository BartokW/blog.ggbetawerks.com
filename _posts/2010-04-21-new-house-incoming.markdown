I think most of my family is aware that my wife and I are building a new house, but thought that some people might be interested, and not know yet, so here's your notice. :)  
  
The new place will be South and a little West of where we are now, but in a similar area. We will have a real guest room, unlike the current house which has a room that can be used as a guest room. Will have a triple car garage, so that we can actually fit two vehicles in there. Looks to be about 2600 square feet, with a 500 square foot bonus room above the garage, and an unfinished basement.  
  
We have obtained the building permits, and are now just waiting for them to become active, and the builder to be ready to start. The plan is to start about the middle of May, with a completion of late October / early November. Needless to say, we're starting to get excited as things are getting closer to actually starting. :)
