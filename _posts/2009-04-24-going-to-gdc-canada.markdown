Well, it looks like I am going to Game Developers ConferenceÂ® Canada. When I first started this job, my boss had asked if I would like to attend GDC sometime, however, it being in San Francisco, I figured it probably wasn't going to happen, as it gets pretty expensive pretty quickly. However, this year there is a Canadian version in Vancouver, so I thought that maybe, just maybe, it might be getting closer to being a reality to go to a Game Conference. Well, my boss has registered us, and we've got plane tickets, so we're good to go. Just have to wait a couple more weeks until it starts. Looks like there are a number of interesting talks, so I'm hoping I'll learn at least a little, and maybe meet some people. Will have to post more once I get back.
